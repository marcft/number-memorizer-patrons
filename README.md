# Number Memorizer via Patrons

This project is a number memorizer tool designed to help users memorize sequences of numbers, such as the digits of Pi or any other numerical sequence. It was initially created to assist my brother in memorizing the digits of Pi in manageable chunks but can be adapted for various purposes.

## Features

- **Big Number Input:** Users can input a large number sequence, such as chunks of Pi, or any other sequence they wish to memorize.
- **Interactive Guessing:** Users interactively guess the digits of the input number by clicking on a numbers grid.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** If a guessed digit is correct, the corresponding number tile on the grid changes color to indicate correctness.
- **Next Digit Assistance:** In case users are unsure of the next digit, a "Next" button provides assistance by revealing the next digit to be guessed.
- **Flexible Use:** While designed for memorizing Pi, the tool can be applied to memorize any sequence of numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (JS):** For the functionality and interactivity of the application.
- **HTML:** For the structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling and visual presentation.
